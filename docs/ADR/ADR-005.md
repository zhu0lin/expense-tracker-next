# ADR-005: Refactor from Vite to Next.js

## Status
Accepted

## Context
I refactored from Vite to Next.js. I have yet to refactor all component files to include the 'use client' i.e. for
files using hooks, I've yet to update them to include 'use client'.  

**Requirements:**
- Refactor from Vite to Next.js
- Include 'use client' on top of files that use hooks
- Initialize and commit to a new repository 

**Options considered:**
1. **Vite**: Vite taught me React. Next.js teaches me production full-stack development.
2. **Next.js**: It solves production problems: performance, SEO, deployment complexity, and full-stack architecture. 

## Decision


**Rationale:**
- 

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Automatic routing based on your file structure (no React Router configuration)
- Built-in API routes for backend functionality (no separate Express server)
- Server-side rendering for faster page loads and better SEO
- Automatic optimizations that would take weeks to configure manually

**Negative:**
- 

**Mitigation:**
-
