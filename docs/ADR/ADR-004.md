# ADR-004: Tailwind CSS integration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
I utilized Tailwind CSS in my React components, removing the need of writing custom CSS files for each component. 

**Requirements:**
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS in your React TypeScript expense tracker project
- Transform existing custom CSS components into Tailwind utility-based implementations
- Implement responsive design patterns using Tailwind's mobile-first breakpoint system
- Apply GitHub workflow practices including branching and meaningful commits for styling changes

**Options considered:**
1. **Utility based implementation with Tailwind**: Build interfaces faster with prebuilt utilities, mobile-first design built into every utility, and shared design language across developers
2. **Vanilla CSS**: Slower building components, harder to maintain systematic design across all interfaces.

## Decision
We will use Tailwind CSS, which follows better consistency and maintability.

**Rationale:**

## Consequences
