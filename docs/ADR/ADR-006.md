# ADR-006: AWS LocalStack 

## Status
Accepted

## Context
I explore what LocalStack is, and why it's valuable for cloud development. Modern applications need more than text data. Users expect to upload profile pictures, attach receipts, share documents, and store files. The industry standard is AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service).

**Requirements:**
- File upload form with validation
- Receipt storage in LocalStack S3
- Receipt URLs linked to expenses
- "View Receipt" links on expense cards


**Options considered:**
1. **AWS S3**: During development, I'd pay for test uploads and every API request.
2. **LocalStack**: Emulates AWS S3, allowing me to learn AWS S3 functionalities without having to pay.

## Decision
LocalStack

**Rationale:**
- Allows me to learn AWS S3 from a safe, free tool.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- 

**Negative:**
- 

**Mitigation:**
-
