# ADR-003: TypeScript integration with union types for better type safety

## Status
Accepted

## Context
I created union types with TypeScript to align with best practices of TypeScript and better type safety.

**Requirements:**
- Ensure props have union types if they currently use string types
- Allow for better error handling

**Options considered:**
1. **Union types**: Better type safety and developer experience
2. **String types**: Harder to track, debug, and fix errors. Errors will not be specific compared to TypeScript errors.

## Decision
We will use union types, which follows TypeScript best practices.

**Rationale:**
- 

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- 

**Negative:**
- 

**Mitigation:**
