# ADR-002: Created components for project reusability

## Status
Accepted

## Context
I created components with TypeScript to align with best practices of project reusability and separation of concerns.

**Requirements:**
- Ensure components can be reused in other parts of project
- Allows for separation of concerns in each individual component

**Options considered:**
1. **Components**: Reusable and follows best practices of separation of concerns
2. **All in one App.tsx file**: Significantly harder for code readibility, does not allow for reusability

## Decision
We will use individual components, which follows reusability and overall best practices.

**Rationale:**
- 

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- 

**Negative:**
- 

**Mitigation:**
-
