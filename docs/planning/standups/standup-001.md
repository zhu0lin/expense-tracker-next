# Standup - Week 1

## What I Completed
- [x] Set up GitHub CodeSpaces environment
- [x] Configured GitHub Copilot for responsible AI assistance
- [x] Created comprehensive project documentation (README, ADR-001)
- [x] Learned agile methodology fundamentals
- [x] Initialized professional project structure

## What I'm Working On
- [ ] Planning React component architecture
- [ ] Setting up TypeScript interfaces for expense data
- [ ] Creating initial wireframes for user interface
- [ ] Learning advanced Copilot features responsibly

## Blockers
- [ ] Need clarification on database schema requirements
- [ ] Unsure about optimal component structure patterns
- [ ] Want to understand ADR best practices for future decisions

## Learning Goals This Week
- [ ] Master TypeScript with React development
- [ ] Understand professional documentation standards
- [ ] Improve GitHub Copilot usage patterns
- [ ] Practice agile ceremony participation

## Notes
Today's focus on professional practices immediately changed how I think about 
development. Documentation isn't overhead - it's communication with future teammates 
and future me.

## AI Usage Reflection
**Effective Copilot Usage Today:**
- Generated boilerplate README structure, then customized content
- Helped explain TypeScript syntax in context
- Suggested project structure improvements

**Manual Coding Preferred:**
- Writing ADR content (requires human reasoning about trade-offs)
- Making architectural decisions (needs understanding of requirements)
- Creating project roadmap (requires domain knowledge and planning)
